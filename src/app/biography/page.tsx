                Early Life in Chicago
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Robert Francis Prevost was born on September 14, 1955, in
                Chicago, Illinois to a family with rich cultural heritage. His
                father, Louis Marius Prevost, had French and Italian roots and
                served as a catechist. His mother, Mildred Mart√≠nez, was of
                Spanish descent and known for her warm hospitality, often
                welcoming priests into their family home.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Young Robert was deeply influenced by his early experiences with
                the Church. He served as an altar boy and attended the parish
                school, where he developed a strong foundation in faith. The
                steady stream of clergy who visited his home and his father's {/* Fixed */}
                example as a catechist helped shape his early understanding of
                religious service.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                His multilingual household would later prove valuable in his
                global ministry, as he grew up with exposure to different
                cultures and languages, reflecting the universal nature of the
                Church he would one day lead.

                Prevost's academic journey began at the minor seminary of the {/* Fixed */}
                Order of St. Augustine, where he completed his secondary studies
                in 1973. He then pursued higher education at Villanova
                University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in
                1977, demonstrating his aptitude for analytical thinking that
                would later serve him well in leadership positions.

              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                After discerning his vocation to the priesthood, he joined the
                Order of St. Augustine (OSA) in September 1977, taking his first
                vows in September 1978 and his solemn vows in August 1981. This
                commitment to the Augustinian order would shape his spirituality
                and approach to ministry throughout his life.

              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Prevost continued his studies at Catholic Theological Union in
                Chicago, earning a Master of Divinity degree in 1982, the same
                year he was ordained to the priesthood. He then pursued advanced
                studies in Canon Law at the Pontifical University of Saint
                Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome, earning both a Licentiate
                (1984) and a Doctorate (1987). His doctoral thesis, "The role {/* Fixed */}

              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Prevost's connection to Peru began in 1985 when he joined the {/* Fixed */}
                Augustinian mission there, serving as chancellor of the
                Territorial Pr√©lature of Chulucanas until 1986. After a brief
                return to the United States, he went back to Peru in 1988 for
                what would become a decade of transformative ministry.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                During these ten years in Trujillo, Peru, Prevost took on
                multiple roles that demonstrated his administrative abilities
                and pastoral heart. He headed the Augustinian seminary, taught
                canon law in the diocesan seminary, and served as prefect of
                studies. His expertise in canon law was recognized as he served
                as a judge of the regional ecclesiastical court and as a member
                of the college of consultors of Trujillo.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Beyond his administrative and academic roles, Prevost maintained
                a direct connection with the faithful by leading a congregation
                on the outskirts of Trujillo. This combination of leadership
                responsibilities and direct pastoral work gave him a
                comprehensive understanding of the Church's mission and {/* Fixed */}
                challenges in Latin America, a perspective that would prove
                valuable in his later global roles.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                His time in Peru culminated years later when Pope Francis
                appointed him Bishop of Chiclayo in 2015, after he had served as
                apostolic administrator of the diocese since 2014. This return
                to Peru deepened his connection to the country and its people,
                eventually leading to his acquisition of Peruvian citizenship,
                making him a dual citizen of the United States and Peru.

                Leadership in the Augustinian Order

              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Prevost's leadership abilities were recognized early in his {/* Fixed */}
                religious life. In 1998, he was elected provincial of the
                Augustinian Province of Chicago, returning to the United States
                to assume this position in March 1999. This role marked the
                beginning of a series of significant leadership positions that
                would shape his administrative approach.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                His most significant leadership role came in 2001 when he was
                elected Prior General of the Order of Saint Augustine, the
                highest position within the order worldwide. This six-year term
                was renewed in 2007, giving him a total of twelve years at the
                helm of the Augustinian community globally. This experience
                provided him with extensive international exposure and honed his
                abilities to lead a diverse religious community across cultural
                boundaries.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Upon completing his second term as Prior General in 2013,
                Prevost returned to Chicago where he served as director of
                formation in the Convent of St. Augustine, as well as first
                councilor and provincial vicar of the province of Our Mother of
                Good Counsel, which covers the midwestern United States.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                Throughout these leadership roles, Prevost developed a
                reputation for thoughtful decision-making, attentive listening,
                and a collaborative approach to governance‚Äîqualities that would
                later be valued in his episcopal ministry and Vatican service.

                pastoral experience when he appointed him as a member of the
                Congregation for the Clergy in July 2019. This appointment was
                followed by his naming as a member of the Congregation for

              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
                On January 30, 2023, Pope Francis appointed Prevost as Prefect
                of the Dicastery for Bishops, a pivotal role in the Vatican that
                oversees the selection of bishops worldwide. This appointment
                placed him at the center of the Church's governance, giving him {/* Fixed */}
                significant influence over the future leadership of dioceses
                globally. Simultaneously, he was named president of the
                Pontifical Commission for Latin America, reflecting his deep
                connection to the region.

                In recognition of his service and important position, Pope
                Francis created Prevost a cardinal on September 30, 2023,
                assigning him the title of cardinal-deacon of Santa Monica degli
                Agostiniani Church in Rome. On February 6, 2025, Pope Francis
                further promoted him to cardinal-bishop, assigning him to the
                Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano in the Province of Rome, one of
