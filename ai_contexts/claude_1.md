## Biography

### Early Life and Family Background
Robert Francis Prevost was born to a family with rich cultural heritage in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Louis Marius Prevost, had French and Italian roots and served as a catechist in their local parish. His mother, Mildred Martínez, was of Spanish descent and known for her hospitality. Their home frequently welcomed priests, exposing young Robert to clergy from an early age.

Growing up in this devout Catholic household, Robert served as an altar boy and attended the parish school. The multicultural environment of his upbringing helped shape his global perspective and facility with languages that would serve him well in his international ministry.

### Education and Religious Formation
Prevost's academic journey began at the minor seminary of the Order of St. Augustine, where he completed his secondary studies in 1973. He then attended Villanova University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics in 1977, demonstrating his analytical abilities.

Upon graduation, Prevost entered the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine (OSA) in September 1977, taking his first vows in September 1978 and his solemn vows on August 29, 1981. He continued his preparation for priesthood at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, earning a Master of Divinity degree.

He was ordained a priest in 1982 and subsequently sent to Rome for further studies, where he obtained a Licentiate (1984) and a Doctorate (1987) in Canon Law from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum). His doctoral thesis focused on "The role of the local prior in the Order of Saint Augustine," foreshadowing his future leadership roles.

### Ministry in Peru
Prevost's connection to Peru began in 1985 when he joined the Augustinian mission there, serving as chancellor of the Territorial Prélature of Chulucanas until 1986. After a brief return to the United States where he worked as pastor for vocations and director of missions for the Augustinian Province of Chicago, he returned to Peru in 1988 for what would become a decade of transformative ministry.

During his ten years in Trujillo, Peru, Prevost:
- Headed the Augustinian seminary
- Taught canon law in the diocesan seminary
- Served as prefect of studies
- Acted as judge of the regional ecclesiastical court
- Participated as a member of the college of consultors of Trujillo
- Led a congregation on the outskirts of the city

This extensive experience in Peru deeply shaped his understanding of the Church in Latin America and the Global South, perspectives he would later bring to his Vatican roles and ultimately to the papacy.

### Leadership in the Augustinian Order
In 1998, Prevost was elected provincial of the Augustinian Province of Chicago, returning to the United States to assume this position in March 1999. 

His most significant leadership role came in 2001 when he was elected Prior General of the Order of Saint Augustine, the highest position within the Augustinian community worldwide. This six-year term was renewed in 2007, giving him a total of twelve years leading the global Augustinian community. During this period, he traveled extensively, visiting Augustinian communities around the world and developing a truly global perspective on the Church.

After completing his second term as Prior General in 2013, Prevost returned to Chicago where he served as:
- Director of formation in the Convent of St. Augustine
- First councilor and provincial vicar of the province of Our Mother of Good Counsel

Throughout these leadership roles, he became known for his thoughtful decision-making, attentive listening, and collaborative approach to governance.

### Episcopal Ministry
On November 3, 2014, Pope Francis appointed Prevost as apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, and titular bishop of Sufar. He received his episcopal consecration on December 12, 2014, at St. Mary's Cathedral in Chiclayo. On September 26, 2015, he was named bishop of Chiclayo, returning him to ministry in Peru.

Within the Episcopal Conference of Peru, Prevost served on the permanent council for the 2018 to 2020 term and was elected in 2019 as president of its Commission for Education and Culture. He was also a member of the leadership of Caritas Peru.

From April 15, 2020, to 2021, he also served as apostolic administrator of Callao, Peru, taking on additional responsibilities during a time of need.

During his time as bishop, he was known for his:
- Focus on pastoral care and accessibility to his flock
- Promotion of education and cultural initiatives
- Support for social justice and care for the poor
- Commitment to child protection and diocesan transparency
- Work fostering vocations and strengthening priestly formation

### Vatican Service and Elevation to Cardinal
Pope Francis recognized Prevost's talents when he appointed him as a member of the Congregation for the Clergy in July 2019, followed by his naming as a member of the Congregation for Bishops in November 2020.

The pivotal moment in his Vatican service came on January 30, 2023, when Pope Francis appointed Prevost as Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, a key role overseeing the selection of bishops worldwide. Simultaneously, he was named president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.

In recognition of his service and important position, Pope Francis created Prevost a cardinal on September 30, 2023, assigning him the title of cardinal-deacon of Santa Monica degli Agostiniani Church in Rome. On February 6, 2025, he was further promoted to cardinal-bishop, assigning him to the Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano.

As Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, Cardinal Prevost implemented several notable initiatives:
- Added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the pope
- Emphasized the selection of bishops with strong pastoral experience
- Promoted transparency and thorough investigation of candidates

## Papal Election

### The Conclave
Following the death of Pope Francis on April 21, 2025, the College of Cardinals gathered in Rome for the conclave. The voting began on May 7, 2025, with 133 cardinal electors participating. 

On May 8, 2025, white smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling that a new pope had been elected. Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost had secured the necessary two-thirds majority (at least 89 votes).

When asked what name he would take as pope, he chose "Leo XIV" - a choice that carries significant historical and symbolic meaning.

### First Appearance
When Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran made the traditional "Habemus Papam" announcement from the central loggia of St. Peter's Basilica, he proclaimed that Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost had been elected and had taken the name Leo XIV.

Pope Leo XIV then appeared on the balcony, greeting the faithful gathered in St. Peter's Square with these words: [First words as Pope - to be updated when available]

His election was historic as he became the first American to be elected pope, breaking a long tradition of European pontiffs that was only briefly interrupted by Pope Francis, who was from Argentina.

## Significance of the Name Leo XIV

### Historical Context of Papal Names
The tradition of popes taking a new name dates back to the 6th century when Pope John II (533-535 AD) chose to change his birth name, Mercurius, which had pagan associations. The practice became standard by the late 10th century.

The name a pope chooses often signals the direction and priorities of his papacy, reflecting admiration for previous popes or saints whose legacy they wish to continue.

### The Leo Legacy
By choosing the name Leo XIV, Pope Prevost connects himself to a distinguished line of popes who bore the name Leo:

- **Leo I "The Great" (440-461)**: A Doctor of the Church known for his theological contributions, especially regarding Christology, and for his diplomatic skills in turning away Attila the Hun from Rome in 452. Pope Benedict XVI described Leo I's papacy as "undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history."

- **Leo XIII (1878-1903)**: Known for opening dialogue between the Church and the modern world. He authored the groundbreaking encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), which addressed the conditions of the working class and laid the foundation for Catholic social teaching. He was called the "Rosary Pope" for his strong promotion of Marian devotion.

- **Leo XII (1823-1829)**: Known for ecclesiastical reforms and his efforts to combat secret societies and religious indifference.

By selecting Leo XIV as his papal name, Robert Francis Prevost appears to signal:
- A commitment to clear theological teaching and strong leadership (Leo I)
- An openness to engaging with modern challenges while upholding tradition (Leo XIII)
- A potential focus on social justice issues and the dignity of workers
- The importance of both intellectual rigor and diplomatic skill in Church leadership

Leo XIII specifically said when selecting his name: "As Leo XIII, in remembrance of Leo XII, whom I have always venerated." This suggests that Pope Leo XIV may similarly have a particular connection to or admiration for one of the previous Pope Leos.

## Theological and Pastoral Priorities

### Views and Approach
Based on his previous statements and work, Pope Leo XIV is known for:

- **Theological Moderation**: Considered a centrist who balances traditional Catholic teaching with pastoral sensitivity

- **Global Perspective**: His experience in both North and South America gives him unique insights into the Church's challenges across different cultural contexts

1. **Church Reform and Synodality**: Continuing and possibly expanding the synodal approach championed by Pope Francis
